Create a Backend for my finance based web application using ASP.NET 8.0 with SQL Server using the connection string "Server=localhost;Database=BackendDb;Trusted_Connection=True;TrustServerCertificate=True;"
I need fully secured web application.
It has four layer of users such as Super Admin, Society Admin, User (as Accountant) and member. Here member doesn't need to authenticate of panel for now.
The super admin should be login with username = "superadmin" and password = "superadmin" when superadmin login that should be navigate to super admin panel.
